A vibrant 2048 game logo featuring a stylized 4x4 grid of colorful tiles. The background is a soft gradient from light blue at the top to light purple at the bottom. Each tile is a square with rounded corners, displaying a number in the center: the top-left tile shows "2", the top-right shows "4", the middle-left shows "8", the middle-right shows "16", the bottom-left shows "32", the bottom-right shows "64". The tiles are arranged in a 4x4 pattern with a subtle drop shadow. The overall composition is centered and balanced, with the grid slightly tilted to give a dynamic feel. The logo should be eye‑catching and suitable for a web app icon.
